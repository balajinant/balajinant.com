        <p style="color: #ffffff;">Introduction</p>
        <div>
            <p>
                This article shares my journey of designing an e-commerce application tailored for our business clientele, including restaurants, supermarkets, hypermarkets, and grocery 
                stores. We are their source for groceries, fruits, and vegetables. Traditionally, these customers placed their orders through phone calls, WhatsApp, or directly with our sales team, 
                avoiding our previous app due to its lack of user-friendliness. The goal was to overhaul the app, making it a comprehensive platform where our customers could easily browse our full catalog, 
                order products at their convenience, and effortlessly manage their orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, the scope of the redesign wasn’t fully clear. The product and design teams gradually uncovered the true breadth of work required. It started with the intention to merely update 
                the app’s onboarding process and its visual appeal. However, as we delved deeper, the need to enhance the home page, add features, and improve the product listing page became evident. 
                The challenge was to roll out these updates progressively, within a tight timeframe. So, what was our approach? We bypassed the preliminary stages and jumped straight into creating detailed, 
                high-fidelity designs based on initial user and business research.

            “If you're looking for a standard design case study, this isn't it. <br>
This is about my experience designing in a fast-paced startup.”

        <p style="color: #ffffff;">The Process</p>
        <div>
            <p>
                In a startup, speed to market is crucial, so we prioritize quick access to real-time data for faster problem-solving. Our process involved receiving requirements from the business, conducting research, 
                and suggesting improvements before fully committing to design. Due to time constraints, we bypassed wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes, moving directly to high-fidelity designs based on our knowledge
                 and intuition. We delivered these designs in segments for swift development, making many design decisions along the way to ensure the process was both efficient and effective.

        <p style="color: #ffffff;">Highlights</p>
        <div>
            <p>
                To ensure this article is concise and to the point, I'll highlight three key design decisions: <br>
                1. Visual Design <br>
                2. Product Card <br>
                3. Order Management
            </p>
            <p style="color: #ffffff; padding-bottom: 0px;">1. Visual Design</p>
            <p>We aimed to provide a user experience similar to that of a B2C app for our B2B customers. Recognizing
                 that our users are accustomed to consumer-facing apps, we designed our app's theme to align with those 
                 standards, ensuring a familiar and intuitive interface.

        <div>
            <p style="color: #ffffff; padding-bottom: 0px;">2. Product Cards</p>
            <p>
                Crafting the product cards required careful attention to detail. Given that including extensive product 
                details for every SKU was beyond our scope and budget, we had to strategically condense vital information into a
                 compact space. This involved prioritizing data like profit margins and adapting the layout to accommodate various product 
                 offerings, such as special deals and bundles, ensuring key information was always front and center.

        <div>
            <p style="color: #ffffff; padding-bottom: 0px;">3. Order Management</p>
            <p>
                Designing the order management system presented a complex challenge. We identified over 30 different scenarios 
                that could occur from the moment an order is placed until its delivery. This ranged from handling in-stock items to managing out-of-stock 
                situations where orders might be split or partially delivered. We designed the system to be flexible, allowing for partial acceptance 
                or rejection of orders upon delivery, and incorporated solutions for scenarios like customer unavailability. To streamline these processes,
                 we've proposed operational adjustments to our stakeholders, aiming to simplify these scenarios.

        <p style="color: #ffffff;">Conclusion</p>
        <div>
            <p>
                We successfully redesigned the app within our set timeline and introduced it to our customers, who were pleased with its user-friendly design
                 that meets modern standards. However, we received feedback highlighting some issues with delivery and product availability. Now, with a solid 
                 design foundation established, it's crucial for the operational side of the business to evolve to fully satisfy customer needs. This experience 
                 taught me that while the product design and development process can be disorderly, it's essential to identify priorities, streamline our approach,
                  and stay focused on our objectives.
